INSTALL YOUR OWN VERSION OF WIDGETS EXTENSION IN GAME DEVELOP
=============================================================

To install your own version of the Widgets Extension in Game Develop, you need first to compile the extension (see README.txt for further informations).

Note : 	GDDIR designated the folder containing Game Develop.
	The "?" symbol in files depends of your operating system ("w" on Windows, "l" on Linux)

When you have compiled the extension, you have to copy the following files :
  - build/releaseedittime/Widgets.xgd?e to GDDIR/Extensions/
  - build/release/Widgets.xgd? to GDDIR/Extensions/
  - extlibs/SFGUI/include/SFGUI (entire folder) to GDDIR/include/GDL/ (paste as a sub-folder of this)
  - extlibs/SFGUI/sfgui.dll (or libsfgui.so on Linux) to GDDIR/
  - src/*.h (all files ending with .h) to GDDIR/Extensions/include/Widgets
  - all the sub-folders of src/ to GDDIR/Extensions/include/Widgets (paste as sub-folder of this)

Then, start Game Develop. If Game Develop doesn't report any errors, the extension is ready to use.
